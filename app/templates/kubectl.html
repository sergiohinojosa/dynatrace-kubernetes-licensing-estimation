  <h4>ðŸ’» Estimate with Kubectl</h4>
  Is Dynatrace not installed on the Kubernetes Cluster? No problem, even though we recommend to have Dynatrace installed into the kubernetes cluster for an accurate estimation,
    it is still possible to make an estimation based on a snapshot. The shell script mimics the DPS calculation and with assumptions it makes a Pod-hour and Gib-hour estimation. 
    <br>
    At the top of the shell script there is a variable named 'NAMESPACES_TO_EXCLUDE'. You can add namespaces that should be excluded from the Gib-hour calculation. The script assumes 
    that all PODs within a Namespace are instrumentable. Bear in mind that this might not always be the case.
